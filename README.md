## Purpose of the App 

This native Android app helps users study history using flashcards in a True/False quiz format. It displays questions, captures answers, calculates a score, and gives feedback on performance. Designed using Kotlin and Android Studio. 

 

## Design Considerations 

- **Screens**: Welcome screen, Quiz screen, Score screen and Review screen

- **Data**: Questions and answers are stored using parallel arrays. 

- **Logic**: Loops and conditionals determine correctness and track scores. 

- **Navigation**: Uses `Intent` to move between activities.
